\section{Introduction}

This is a sample!  It does not have a lot of fancy stuff in it, but if
you want to see a more complex sample, look at the original ACM
templates.

To fill up enough text to fill up 3 pages, we've included the CCS Call
for Papers three times.  It is always a good idea to include some
gratuitious citations to recent CCS papers~\cite{medvinsky1993netcash,
  bellare1993random, anderson1993cryptosystems, blaze1993cryptographic}.

And here is a plot (\figref{plot-sample}) for the heck of it.

\section{Conclusions}

In conclusion, it is rarely a good idea to include the same section three times in a paper, or to have a conclusion that does not conclude.

But never mind that. We have the president's authorization (see \figref{president-sig}) to go on. Let's make this paper great again!
